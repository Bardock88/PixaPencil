## Name change
**PixaPencil** used to be called 'PyxlMoose'. I decided to call it 'PixaPencil' as I feel as though the name is better than PyxlMoose.

Anyone who wishes to use my old name - PyxlMoose - is free to do so.

## Android market
**PixaPencil** will be available soon on the Google Play Store - and for those for don't feel comfortable purchasing apps from the Play Store - it will also be available on F-Droid. It will also be available as a standalone apk file on GitHub.
