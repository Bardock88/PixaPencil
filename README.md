If you are wanting to make an app similar to PyxlMoose (a pixel art editor for Android), you can use, modify, and distribute any code which is part of this codebase privately or commercially. I encourage anyone wanting to make a similar or even better version of this app to go ahead!

_Do not use the name 'PyxlMoose' or the logo in your app._

## Progress
PyxlMoose is the world's fastest progressing Android pixel art editor.

## Goal
PyxlMoose is a project I am submitting for NCEA Level 3 Digital Technologies.

It was intended as being a small pixel art editor app for Android, but over time the codebase has grown bigger and hopefully this project can actually turn into something more serious than a school project.
