## Shoutout
_Thank you to PapaBread#3820 on Discord for helping me out with the mathematics required to add a mirror tool into the app._

Because I want the code from this project to be accessible and open, I will show you guys the methodology used to mirror a pixel, I thought it would also be quite interesting to share:

``` Kotlin
override fun onPixelTapped(pixel: View) {
        val indexOfIt = data.indexOf(pixel)
        val pos = indexOfIt % spanCount
        if (isMirrorMode) {
            data[(indexOfIt - pos) + (spanCount - pos) - 1].setBackgroundColor(
                getSelectedColour()
            ) // Credits to PapaBread for this masterpiece of a solution
        }


        pixel.setBackgroundColor(getSelectedColour())
    }
```

_Also thank you JohnWick_007#8119 on Discord for providing me some icons to use in my app._
