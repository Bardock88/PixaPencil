Improvements Added
- Translation updates

Bugs Fixed
- Fixed bug in which inputting an out of bounds spray radius/strength value would show 'Value must be between 1 and 10,000' instead of the expected 'Value must be between 2 and 10,000'
- Fixed bug where the user could use pixel perfect mode with a symmetry option selected which would then cause bugs
- Fixed bug where the transparent primary/secondary color would have a partial black background (instead of white) in dark mode
- Fixed bug in which the 'Compression Quality' text box and 'Resolution' radio buttons were not showing in landscape mode in the 'Export' dialog

Other Changes
- Haptic feedback may not occur in the app if it's disabled on your device due to SDK updates
