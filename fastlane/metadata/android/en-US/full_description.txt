PixaPencil is the number one open source pixel art editor for Android.

Why you should try out PixaPencil:

- Contains over 33+ useful features (see 'Features' section below)
- 100% free of evil Google Play (tracking) services
- 100% free of evil (tracking) advertisements
- 100% commitment to open source
- Warning: if you have a phone with a very small screen size (e.g. 400x800 Galaxy Core Prime) this app will not work well. Keep that in mind. I am working on making this app more compatible with smaller screen sizes, but for now it's on hold.

PixaPencil is available in either English (US), English (UK/NZ/AU, etc), or Hebrew.

PixaPencil only runs on Android 8.0 or higher.
